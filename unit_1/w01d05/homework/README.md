If you want to review some HTML/CSS before getting started refer back to these videos:

## Deliverables

> `index.html` and `styles.css` files that try to recreate the FlexDash mockup as best as you can. 

#### A few notes: 

1. **The main thing we want you to focus on is the positioning/layout by using _flexbox_ (required!)**
1. Try to use at list one `<ul>` element in your code somwhere and make sure you get rid of the default styling (by default, ul's make every list item have a bullet point in front of them; to get rid of the bulllet point, look up `list-style-type`!) 
1. The footer should contain anchor tags, be sure to remove the default underline and change the color of these links. All links should be dummy links going to `#`
1. Your colors  _do not_ have to match, feel free to change those up to add your own style! 
1. Pick a similar font to the mockup by using Google Fonts or another font resource
1. Just do your best to recreate it to the best of your abilities! 
1. Bonus stretch goal: try to make the footer sticky

#### Tips 

Not sure where to start? Here are two tips to get you started 

1. Lay out the HTML first before you do any CSS! Look at the mockup and then write out each element you think you'll need inside your html file 
1. Have the [CSS-Tricks guide to flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) open as you work!

## Hungry for More 

1. If you finish with plenty of time and energy left, take this chance to practice more styling and try to add your own pizzazz! See below for an extreme example of what kind of styling you can do to snazz it up 

<details><summary>Extreme example -- don't feel like your styling has to match!</summary><p>

The example below is just to show you how much you can do with some CSS. We of course don't expect you to recreate this, but just show you what is possible with lots of experience. For now, just add whatever styling you want and can!
