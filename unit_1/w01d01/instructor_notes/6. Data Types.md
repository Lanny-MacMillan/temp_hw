# Datatypes

## Lesson Objectives
- Be able to identify the basic datatypes in JavaScript.
- Be able to write some basic JavaScript following proper syntax and conventions.

### Strings

A string is made up of characters, and it is wrapped in quotes or back ticks.

Here are some examples:

- "Hello, world"
- 'Hello, galaxy'
- \`Hello, universe\`

**GOTCHA** - many word applications (including Slack) convert dumb quotes `""` or `''` into smart quotes `“...”` - JavaScript doesn't recognize smart quotes as valid code.

#### Activity
- Console log `Hello, World` in the three different ways listed above.

### Numbers

Numbers, in JavaScript can be both integers and floating point numbers (numbers with decimals).

- `1` - integer (whole number).
- `1.1` - floating point number (number with a decimal).
- `Infinity` (must be capital I) and `-Infinity`.
- NaN - not a number a value that arises when one attempts mathematical operations on one or more things that are not numbers.

#### Activity
Console log the following:
- 100
- 1 + 1

### Variables

A variable can be made up of letters, numbers and some characters (like `_` and `$`). It cannot start with a number. It is capable of holding any kind of data. Variables are case sensitive: blackCat is not the same as blackcat or BlackCat or BLACKCAT etc.

It is **NOT** wrapped in quotes - this is how JavaScript distinguishes a string (has quotes) versus a variable (no quotes)

It must be declared using `let` or `const`. You can use `var`, but `var` is an older syntax.

JavaScript convention for variable names is to use camelCase, this is different from snake_case (though languages like ruby and python use this), and sausage-case (or kebab-case) which you'll see in HTML.

```js
  const a = 'the letter a'
  let bB8 = 8
  var c3PO = 'cool robot'
```

### Semicolons

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Most of the time, you do not need a semi-colon for JavaScript.

Should you always use a semi-colon? This is hotly debated and will vary depending on your company/team.

Be open minded, try out different styles - but do try to be consistent within a lab/hw/project.

### Concatenating Values
Sometimes (oftentimes), you need to put expressions together.

JavaScript lets us add strings and numbers together with `+`

```javascript
console.log('hello' + ' world');
```

> => 'hello world'

We can insert values of variables into our strings:

```javascript
const adjective = 'beautiful';

console.log('What a ' + adjective + ' day!!');
```

> => "What a beautiful day!!"

```javascript
const adjective = 'crummy';

console.log('What a ' + adjective + ' day!!');
```

> => "What a crummy day!!"

### Booleans & Operators

The values `true` and `false`

Additionally, in the next lesson we'll cover Boolean operators and checks for equivalency  like `||`, `&&`, `===`, `>` etc.

### Null, Undefined

These values mean that the value is not assigned.


### Arrays and Objects

Arrays (called lists in other languages) can hold many items and different types of items - these items can be numbers, strings, variables, and even other arrays!

An array is represented with square brackets `[]` and each item is separated by commas. We'll have an entire lesson dedicated to them!

```js
[1,2,3,4]
```

Objects (sometimes called dictionaries or hashes in other languages) can hold many items, but they have key and value pairs. We'll have an entire lesson dedicated to them!

An object is represented with curly braces `{}` and each key is separated from its value with a `:` and each key value pair is separated by a comma.

```js
{
  school: 'General Assembly',
  class: 'Software Engineering Immersive',
}
```

### typeof

If you need to figure out the type of something you can use `typeof`

Let's try it:

```js
console.log(typeof 1)
console.log(typeof 'hello')
console.log(typeof true)
```
