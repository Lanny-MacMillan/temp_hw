![studio ghibli landscape](https://peakmemory.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/cliufqx.jpg)

You'll be creating a simple, terminal game to send messages and receive input from the user. 

#### Learning Objectives

- Putting everything you've learned so far together (arrays, loops, conditionals)

#### Prerequisites

- JavaScript (arrays, loops, conditionals)

---

## Getting Started

1. Inside of the student_labs directory there is already an `app.js` set up and ready to go!

## Landscaper 

1. You are starting a landscaping business, but all you have are your teeth.
1. Using just your teeth, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $1.  You can do this as much as you want.

    <hr>
    &#x1F534; <b>Commit your work!</b> <br>
    Your commit message should read something like: <br>
    "landscaper: user can use teeth to cut grass"
    <hr>

1. At any point, if you are currently using your teeth, you can buy a pair of rusty scissors for $5.  You can do this once, assuming you have enough money.

    <hr>
    &#x1F534; <b>Commit your work!</b> <br>
    Your commit message should read something like: <br>
    "landscaper: user can buy scissors"
    <hr>

1. Using the rusty scissors, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $5.  You can do this as much as you want.

    <hr>
    &#x1F534; Commit:  <br>
    "Landscaper App: user can use scissors to cut grass"
    <hr>

1. At any point, if you are currently using rusty scissors, you can buy an old-timey push lawnmower for $25.  You can do this once, assuming you have enough money.

    <hr>

    Your commit message should read something like: <br>
    "landscaper: user can buy push lawnmower"

    <hr>
    &#x1F534; <b>Commit your work!</b> <br>
    Your commit message should read something like: <br>
    "landscaper: user can use push lawnmower to cut grass"
    <hr>

1. At any point, if you are currently using the old-timey push lawnmower, you can buy a fancy battery-powered lawnmower for $250.  You can do this once, assuming you have enough money.

    <hr>
    &#x1F534; <b>Commit your work!</b><br>
    Your commit message should read something like: <br>
    "landscaper: user can buy battery-powered lawnmower"
    <hr>

1. Using the the fancy battery-powered lawnmower, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $100.  You can do this as much as you want.

    <hr>
    &#x1F534;  <b>Commit your work!</b> <br>
    Your commit message should read something like: <br>
    "landscaper: user can use battery-powered lawnmower to cut grass"
    <hr>

1. At any point, if you are currently using the fancy battery-powered lawnmower, you can hire a team of starving students for $500.  You can do this once, assuming you have enough money.

    <hr>
    &#x1F534;  <b>Commit your work!</b> <br>
    Your commit message should read something like: <br>
    "landscaper: user can hire a team"
    <hr>

1. Using the the team of starving students, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $250.  You can do this as much as you want.

    <hr>
    &#x1F534;  <b>Commit your work!</b> <br>
    Your commit message should read something like: <br>
    "landscaper: user can use a team to cut grass"
    <hr>

1. You win the game when you have a team of starving students and $1000.  In this situation, send a message to the user telling them, they've won.

    <hr>
    &#x1F534;  <b>Commit your work!</b> <br>
    Your commit message should read something like: <br>
    "landscaper: win scenario"
    <hr>

## Technical Requirements
1. Your landscaper game *must* run on with no syntax errors 
1. If there are errors you can't solve, comment them out and leave a comment above it explaining what is wrong

## Hungry for More?

1. Add the ability to reset the game at any point so that you can play again
1. Make it so that a user can have multiple tools, and money earned each day is increased appropriately (e.g. 2 scissors, and an old-timey push lawnmower means you earn $60/day )
1. Once you've implemented multiple tools, make it so you can sell tools for half price

#### Super duper hungry more?: Landscaper Inspiration

1. Make your terminal game playable via the DOM!

1. Some of our students went above and beyond doing exactly that! See below for some examples:
