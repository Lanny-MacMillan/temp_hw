# Terminal Game

Create any kind of game you want.  Use the `prompt()` function to get user input.  If you can't think of an idea, use [castle battle](castle_battle.md) or [landscaper](landscaper.md)

**GETTING STARTED**

`cd` into this directory and run `npm i` in it.  This will install the `prompt-sync` package which will allow you to run the `prompt()` function.
