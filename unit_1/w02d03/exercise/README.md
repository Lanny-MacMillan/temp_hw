# Intro to Media Queries & Responsive Design

As technology has improved rapidly over the years, allowing for varying screen sizes ranging from a wide desktop monitor all the way down to a slim smartphone screen, web developers have come across the issue of having to make their apps/sites responsive. Or, in other words, having to make things look good and be functional no matter what kind of size screen the user has. While using variable widths and utilizing things like flexbox makes that easier, sometimes it's just not enough. This is where media queries come in handy.

## What is a Media Query?

A media query is a CSS rule that was introduced when CSS3 came out, and its syntax is as follows:

```css
 @media (width rule here, e.g. min-width: 500px) {
  /* any other css rules can go in here as normal, for example: */
  body {
    background: black;
  }
 }
```

#### What a media query does:

  - It looks at the width rule and will only apply the css rules within the media query when the width of the browser meets that width rule point
  - For example, in the above media query it will only make the body's background black when the browser is at 500px width or above

#### Side Question: Can I create rules for other properties aside from width?

 - Yes, the rule inside the parentheses can be something other than width if you'd like, but for the purposes of responsive design and making things look good on certain screen sizes, using some sort of width rule is the most important for you to know.
 - If you'd like to see what other rules you can do, test it out yourself! Or, take a look at the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries).

## Mobile-First Design

When designing responsively, a common philosophy amongst front-end developers is to design for mobile screens first. This is largely because designs and code for larger screens are usually more complex than they are for mobile, thus coding for mobile first starts you off with simpler code and allows you to simply add complexity as needed rather than having to remove or overwrite complexity.

#### So... how do we code mobile-first?

Coding with mobile design first in mind means you want your CSS default styles to be for mobile, and your styles inside media-queries to be for larger widths. Meaning, you generally want your media query rule to have a `min-width` of something, _not_ `max-width`

For example:

```css
/* default style for mobile */
body {
 background: black;
}

/* styles for desktop when the browser is 600px or above */
@media (min-width: 600px) {
 body {
  background: thistle;
 }
}
```

* _NOTE:_ Sometimes, however, you may actually need to use a combination of min and max-width queries to keep your code DRYer. For now, though, let's just get comfortable with min-width queries!

<!-- ## Quick Example

Now that we know a little bit about media queries, let's check it out in action! I'll be going over how I'd go from the mobile view to the desktop view provided below. The sample files are provided in the `spidey_example` folder.

## Viewports
A browser's viewport is the area in which a web page is displayed. On a large screen like a desktop monitor, we usually don't need to think much about the viewport, but smaller screens (such as mobile devices) will load pages onto a "virtual viewport" - a larger screen area than the actual size of the display - then shrinks it down to fit the size of the actual screen. 

While this is helpful for viewing pages which are not optimized for a mobile device, it can lead to unexpected results from media queries. For example, if your media query defines rules for screens with a width of less than 480px but your mobile device's virtual viewport has a width of 900px, then your query rules will never be applied on that mobile device. To get around this issue, it's always a good idea to include the following meta 'viewport' tag in the head of the html on any project which includes media queries:
```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```
This tag tells your mobile browser to use the actual width of the screen instead of using a virtual viewport. If you want to know more about the viewport, or other options you have for your viewport tag, check out the [MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag) for details. 

## Activity

Now it's your turn to play around with media queries! Try to recreate the following simple responsive design wireframes. The images on the left represent the browser at desktop width while the images on the right represent the same browser but at mobile width. We've provided you with some basic starter code in today's morning exercise folder. Feel free to choose whichever one you want to start with, just note you will need to make three separate html and css files for each different one!
