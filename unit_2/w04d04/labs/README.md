# Company Web Site

Create a website for a fictional or real company.  At minimum it should have the following pages:

- Home Page
- Company History
- Past Work
- Staff Page
- Contact Page
- Links Page

The following pages should have data (an array of objects) which is passed into the EJS files.  Put this data into separate files inside a `views` directory and then pass it off to the EJS files:

- Past Work
- Staff Page
- Links Page

## Hungry For More?

Rewrite your unit 1 project as an express app.  Try to put as much text as you can into data and render it in the EJS files
