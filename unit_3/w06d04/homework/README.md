# Single-Page Applications

Now that you've learned how to build a backend and use server-side rendering to create the frontend and build a full CRUD app, for unit 3 we are now going to learn how to create your own backend API and use a front-end framework instead! In essence, you learned how to build multi-page apps in unit 2, and now for unit 3 you will learn how to build single page apps. Unsure what the difference between the two is? No worries, that's what this assignment is for!
