## Getting Started

1. Run `npx create-react-app bakery` in tonight's homework directory.

## Bakery

1. You are opening up a new bakery! You are able to afford some no bake pudding to start!
1. Using just your no bake pudding, you can spend the day baking and make \$1. You can do this as much as you want.

   <hr>
   &#x1F534; <b>Commit your work!</b> <br>
   Your commit message should read something like: <br>
   "bakery: user can make pudding and make money!"
   <hr>

1. At any point, if you are currently using the no bake pudding, you can buy an easy bake oven for \$5. You can do this once, assuming you have enough money.

   <hr>
   &#x1F534; <b>Commit your work!</b> <br>
   Your commit message should read something like: <br>
   "user can buy an easy bake oven"
   <hr>

1. Using the easy bake oven, you can spend the day baking and make \$5. You can do this as much as you want.

   <hr>
   &#x1F534; <b>Commit your work!</b> <br>
   "User can bake with their easy bake oven"
   <hr>

1. At any point, if you are currently using the easy bake oven, you can buy an old-toaster-oven for \$25. You can do this once, assuming you have enough money.

   <hr>
   &#x1F534; <b>Commit your work!</b> <br>
   Your commit message should read something like: <br>
   "User can buy an old toaster oven!"
   <hr>

1. Using the old-toaster-oven, you can spend the day baking and make \$50. You can do this as much as you want.

   <hr>
   &#x1F534; <b>Commit your work!</b> <br>
   Your commit message should read something like: <br>
   "User can bake with the old toaster oven"
   <hr>

1. At any point, if you are currently using the old toaster oven, you can buy a convection oven for \$250. You can do this once, assuming you have enough money.

   <hr>
   &#x1F534; <b>Commit your work!</b><br>
   Your commit message should read something like: <br>
   "user can buy convection oven"
   <hr>

1. Using the the convection oven, you can spend the day baking and make \$100. You can do this as much as you want.

   <hr>
   &#x1F534;  <b>Commit your work!</b> <br>
   Your commit message should read something like: <br>
   "user can bake with the convection oven!"
   <hr>

1. At any point, if you are currently using the convection oven, you can buy a factory to mass product your baked goods for \$500. You can do this once, assuming you have enough money.

   <hr>
   &#x1F534;  <b>Commit your work!</b> <br>
   Your commit message should read something like: <br>
   "user can buy a factory"
   <hr>

1. Using the the factory, you can spend the day baking and make \$250. You can do this as much as you want.

   <hr>
   &#x1F534;  <b>Commit your work!</b> <br>
   Your commit message should read something like: <br>
   "user can mass produce baked goods with the factory"
   <hr>

1. You win the game when you own a factory and have \$1000. In this situation, send a message to the user telling them, they've won.

   <hr>
   &#x1F534;  <b>Commit your work!</b> <br>
   Your commit message should read something like: <br>
   "win condition"
   <hr>

## Deliverables

For this section of the homework, inside the `bakery` folder you should have an `index.html` and `app.js` that simulates the bakery game outlined above. Your app must have:

- The user is able to click on buttons in the DOM to play the game _USING REACT_.
- The ability for the user to earn money
- The ability to buy and use new ovens
- The ability to win the game and end it
    - _Hint:_ Try setting the win amount to $10 frst, then $50, etc. until you get to the end to allow for easier testing!

## Technical Requirements

1. Your bakery game _must_ run on first load with no syntax errors
1. If there are errors you can't solve, comment them out and leave a comment above it explaining what is wrong

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit your homework via github issues and please don't forget to fill out the form!

## Hungry for More?

1. Add the ability to reset the game at any point so that you can start over
1. Make it so that a user can have multiple ovens, and money earned each day is increased appropriately (e.g. 2 puddings, and an old toaster oven means you earn \$60/day )
1. Once you've implemented multiple ovens, make it so you can sell ovens for half the price you bought them for

#### Super duper hungry more?: Bakery Inspiration

1. Portfolio quality CSS!
