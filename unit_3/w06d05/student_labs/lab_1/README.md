# React Static Components

## About this Build

The end (of the program) is near. You've been showing off your portfolio and projects to your friends, family and classmates and they all say "It's fine. I like it!" But you want more insight.

So you decide to look into some analytical tools...but wow! They are expensive! You decide to make your own.

You visualize a dashboard with compontents for reviews, average rating, sentiment analysis and website visitors

Try to recreate this wireframe with React. Be sure to create a few components (e.g. app, sidebar, reviews, average rating, sentiment analysis, website visitors).

## Get Started

### Set up

1. cd into the `.../student_labs/lab_1` folder
1. `npx create-react-app dashboard`
1. `cd dashboard`
1. `atom .`
1. `npm start`

**App.js**

1. Write your first component and render an `h1` tag using react to test it:

    ```jsx
    const App = () => {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
            </div>
        )
    }
    ```

#### Build out the rest of the your components and finish the dashboard!

### Hungry for more???
#### Dark Theme!

Keep going! Add more details, add some css
