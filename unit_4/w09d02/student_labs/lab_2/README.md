#### Prompt
> Build an program that runs in the terminal and allows a user to play hangman using a word randomly selected from a list of words you create.

## Getting Started

1. Inside today's student labs folder, touch a file called `hangman.py`. This is where you'll write your hangman program.

1. To run your program, type `python3 hangman.py`.


## Requirements
- The computer should randomly select a word from a list of words you create.
- The user should be prompted with the length of the word they are trying to guess.
- The user should have a limited number of guesses. If they don't guess the word correctly within the allotted number of guesses, the program should supply a lose statement.
- The program should prompt the user with how many guesses they have left after each guess they make.
- User should be able to see what letters they have guessed correctly and what letters they have guessed incorrectly.
- If the user guesses all of the letters in the word, they should be shown a win statement.

## Hungry For More?
- When the user wins or loses, ask them if they'd like to play again.
- Consider the edge cases. What could a user do that could potentially break the program?
